# Hyperskill-loanCalculator
My 4th Python project from Hyperskill.  The program allows user to calculate differentiated or annuity payments, overpayment, the number of payments or the loan principal.
It requires 4 of the following command-line arguments (two obligatory and two optional, the missing optional parameter is being calculated):

**--type=["annuity"/"diff"]** (obligatory)

**--interest=[value]** (obligatory)

**--principal=[value]** (optional)

**--payment=[value]** (optional)

**--periods=[value]** (optional)
